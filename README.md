# Hi, I'm Julian! Cyber Security Professional

# 👨‍💻 Projects

## Azure
  - [**Azure Privilege Creep: RBAC vs PIM**](https://github.com/Julian-1001/Azure-Privilege-Creep-RBAC-vs-PIM)    
     Scientific, evidence-driven analysis of identity and access control, comparing permanent RBAC assignments with time-bound PIM access using Resource Audits, Azure Activity Logs, and Log Analytics.
    
  - [**Creating a Live SOC / Honey Net in Azure**](https://github.com/Julian-1001/Azure-SOC)    
     Built and monitored a deliberately exposed Azure honeynet, then hardened the environment and measured the reduction in attack activity and security incidents using Sentinel and Log Analytics.

## Cryptography & Blockchain

  - [**A CLI Application to Generate Mnemonic Seed Phrases Offline**](https://github.com/Julian-1001/Phrase_Generator)    
    Built a lightweight, offline Go CLI that generates BIP39-compliant mnemonic seed phrases, focusing on cryptographic correctness, dependency integrity, and minimizing attack surface through an auditable design.

- [**Uniswap V2 Pool Spot Price & TVL Inspector**](https://github.com/Julian-1001/uniswap-v2-pool-inspector)  
  Built a read-only monitoring tool that inspects Uniswap V2 liquidity pools to derive on-chain USD prices, calculate TVL, and detect anomalous behavior without wallets, transactions, or external price oracles.
